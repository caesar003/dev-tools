# DEV TOOLS

```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y && sudo apt dist-upgrade -y && sudo apt autoremove -y

sudo apt install -y kitty tmux git
git clone https://github.com/caesar003/dev-tools ~/.dev-tools
cd ~/.dev-tools
chmod +x ./setup.sh

./setup.sh

# kitty, tmux, nvim,  
# install tpm
# clone compile and build neovim

# install all dependencies, julia, luarocks, building tools, php, composer, python, nodejs 
# 


```


As the config grows, I feel it's really hard to keep them managed
